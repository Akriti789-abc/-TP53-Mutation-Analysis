# ðŸ§¬ TP53 Mutation Analysis Using Python

Project Overview

This project analyzes **TP53 gene mutations** in both **tumor (somatic)** and **germline (inherited)** datasets from the IARC TP53 database.  
It identifies **mutation hotspots** and visualizes them through **bar charts** and a **Venn diagram**.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Datasets Used
- `TumorVariantDownload_r21.csv` â€“ TP53 tumor variants  
- `GermlineDownload_r21.csv` â€“ TP53 germline variants  
Source: [IARC TP53 Database](https://tp53.isb-cgc.org/)

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib-Venn

---

## ðŸ§  Analysis Performed
1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Mutation frequency counting  
3. Visualization of top 10 codons  
4. Comparison between tumor and germline mutations  
5. Venn diagram for overlapping codons  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- Codons **248** and **273** are the most frequent mutation hotspots.  
- These codons appear in both tumor and germline mutations.  
- Indicates crucial regions responsible for **p53 dysfunction** and **cancer risk**.

## ðŸ’¡ How to Run
1. Upload both CSV files and the notebook in Google Colab.  
2. Run each cell in order.  
3. The results will show the bar plots and Venn diagram automatically.
